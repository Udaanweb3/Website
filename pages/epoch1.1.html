               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">Financial Autonomy has become the order of big banks!</p>
               <p class="text"> They have a whole lot of control over our day to day earnings and spending. We really can't blame them as we were the ones who articulated such a juxtaposed reality, allowing a third-party organization to benefit immensely from actions that should have positively affected us and us only. If you want to understand how these 'supposed' custodians of your dirty fiat are exploiting citizens of nation-states; look no further than Europe. Banks in general store your hard-earned dollars and promise to give some yield to you just for keeping your money with them; interest rates vary depending on how much time you lock up your funds with them. Even if you don't do an FD, you can still earn some yield by opening a savings account, which is considerably lower than what you can get by doing an FD but at least you're getting something out of your investment, right? That being said, it's a disappointing way to save for your future as people who aren't well versed with simple macroeconomic dynamics might not understand that the compounding which is supposedly happening is barely enough to nullify inflation; and you were much better off investing in precious metals instead (which is considered to be a safe haven investment amongst all the investable classes currently present in the market).</p>
               <p class="text">Long story short, banks use our capital to generate yield and then give us a very microscopic share of their profits as an interest to keep foolish men like us happy. From the eyes of a well-versed investor, this might be outrageous; but what is criminal is that banks in Europe have this system of negative interest rates where users of their services have to pay a certain amount every year to keep their bank accounts active and the banks, in turn, don't even pay you a dime for entrusting them with your liquidity.
                  The term free market is such a misnomer, that nothing in this world is free. The term free is an illusion as it's a concept of relativity; allow me to explain. Let's take into account the concept of free deliveries that big corporations like Amazon advertise under many products listed on their website. People again don't really do critical thinking about how a service can be supposedly free, especially with the increase in gas prices that have disrupted supply chains for quite some time now. It's highly unlikely that Amazon includes the fee within the price of the product and then advertises it like they're actually being a generous host by valuing you as a customer.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Human minds are trained in such a way that whenever they see the term free, they immediately flock toward it without even analysing the situation. When you're supposed to choose between two products A and B, more often than not you don't compare them on the basis of the net cost of acquisition, you simply float towards the product that has 0 delivery fee, even if the competitive product was of better quality or even cheaper including the delivery fee. This form of marketing has really transformed us into a bunch of freeloaders and more often than not you don't even realise that the delivery fee is already reimbursed by you yourself either in the form of hidden costs or simply by you giving the company a bunch of your data thereby making you a direct product of the company. Data is the new oil of the fourth industrial revolution, and these large mega corporations are feeding on your data to make billions of dollars in revenue what you get in exchange are either 20 dollar discount vouchers which you can again redeem on their website or worse, nothing.  </p>
               <p class="text"> Data literacy is a topic not a lot of people are talking about right now, as it's not something that our imperial corporate overlords would like awareness on. Billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mukesh Ambani etc have built great empires just by feeding on this untouched asset class. We as human beings have never been taught to value our creations, and this culture has enabled these companies to concentrate wealth focally on the richest 1-2% of the world. With projects in this space operating at the crux of this decentralised economy, the main goal of developers is to build decentralised applications,  that can eventually replace this abusive regime of centralised autocracies and thus in turn help with the redistribution of money flowing back to the people from the leaky faucets of these aristocratic personalities. Economic communism might have its fair share of drawbacks, but what this will facilitate is that no one ever would have to part with their conscience to enjoy a few freebies thrown in by these exploitive centralised entities.Money will eventually be of the people, by the people and for the people! You can either embrace change or die trying to fight it.</p>
