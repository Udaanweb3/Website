               <h1>Web 3.0</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">Introduction</p>
               <p class="text">In current times, cryptocurrency and digital assets have gained immense popularity and each individual and icons have their own say in it. Some countries like El Salvador have recognised Bitcoin as a legal tender, whereas other countries are sceptical about it and few have banned crypto. There are various aspects of cryptocurrencies, with a lot of complexity involved with positive aspects like blockchain technology, decentralisation, etc and concerns like crypto crime and money laundering, moreover, there is great risk involved as the market is very volatile and speculative. Under all the events taking place, one can’t help but be intrigued by how the webspace is evolving.</p>
               <p class="subhead">So, what is Web 3.0? </p>
               <p class="text">It is the third generation of internet services for websites and applications on blockchain that are decentralised. Some of the salient features of Web 3.0 are: self-governing, trustless, distributed and robust, verifiable, and permissionless. Users and machines can interact with data through peer to peer networks using Web 3.0 instead of relying on third-party entities, thus, it is free from third-party interference.
                  Here, cryptocurrency plays a major role in these protocols, it provides a financial incentive to the users who participate in creating, contributing or developing a project- this includes varieties of services such as computing, storage, bandwidth, hosting and other web services. 
                  Crypto wallets like MetaMask and Torus enable one to integrate easy, anonymous, and secure international payments and transactions into web3.0 applications. 
               </p>
               <p class="subhead">History of WWW</p>
               <p class="text">In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had recently become a software engineer at CERN noticed a design flaw in the computers at a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. He saw that different computers were tasked with the storage of different data and often they used different programs. It occurred to him that it was easier to wait for a fellow colleague to operate that computer than to try to do it by oneself.</p>
               <p class="text">It was clear to him that he could use the fast-emerging hypertext to his advantage as he watched the internet grow. He filed in a document at his office called ‘Information Management: A Proposal’ to work on it. By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that still remain the foundation of today’s web:</p>
               <p class="text"> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</p>
               <p class="text"> HTML: Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
               <p class="text"> URI: Uniform Resource Identifier.</p>
               <p class="text">As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential wouldn’t be unleashed if people around the world couldn’t use it without paying a fee, mentioning that had the technology been proprietary, and in his total control, it wouldn’t take off.
                  In 1993, the NCSA(National Center for Supercomputing Applications) used CERN’s code to develop Mosaic which could display inline images and submit forms for Windows, Macintosh and X-Windows.
                  In 1995, Bill Gates outlined Microsoft's strategy to dominate the Internet in his tidal wave memo, following the licensing of Mosaic from Spyglass and the release of Internet Explorer 1.0 in 1995.
                  In 1998, Google launched a search engine and people who were using portals switched to Google. From bringing in $70 million in 2000, Google brought in over $100 billion in ad revenue in 2020.
               </p>
               <p class="subhead">Future & development of Web 3.0</p>
               <p class="text">Web3 is a concept for a new era of the internet, based on the decentralised blockchain technology, used by the different cryptocurrencies today like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum, introduced the term back in 2014 but the concept gained the limelight last year from crypto enthusiasts and tech investors as it is a concept that would allow users to buy digital assets and earn money through ad revenue or get ownership for making content on the web or contributing to the web.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Web3 will mark the return of control back to the users and also allow them to share profits, making it the most versatile internet platform to exist to date. It will allow its users to create their own platforms and even reclaim their data.
                  I get that it sounds pollyannish but there lie vast opportunities to shape the future of the web and unrestricted flow of data through web3; there lies hope for common people to strike opportunities but the initial stages will require seldom-seen community support, remember, the community is much more than belonging to something: it’s about doing something together that makes belonging matter. 
               </p>
