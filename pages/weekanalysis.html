               <h1>Week 1 - USDN - The not so stable coin.</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">That's where stable coins come into play.</p>
               <p class="text">The neutrino stable coin, also abbreviated as <b>USDN</b>, is an integral part of the Waves Ecosystem, and this has been headlines in the cryptocurrency space recently for all the wrong reasons. To all those who aren't aware of the project, Waves, also nicknamed the Russian Ethereum, is another Layer 1 blockchain available in the space competing against the likes of more established players like Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. On their website, I personally didn't find anything which is different from what all the other established players are doing, and the website was eerily resembling yet another Layer 1 protocol comprising of generic fluff. However, the charts were speaking an entirely different story as the token pumped more than 300% in a matter of weeks without much technical substance that was released on their official social media accounts. Also, alt season has far from begun as this was an isolated surge and none of the technical indicators is showing bullish momentum any time soon. Was it an organic growth or yet another pump and dump scheme? Let's discuss this situation in depth.</p>
               <p class="text">Needless to say, some whale had been manipulating the price of the Waves token over the past few days, and this again is one of the key differences between the security of a proof of work blockchain and the susceptibility to corruption of a proof of stake network. The centre of attraction of all that went south was the USDN stable coin, and an entity known as Vires Finance.
               </p>
               <p class="text">A little background about Vires Finance, it is just another liquidity aggregator where users can deposit stable coins to earn interest yields on their deposits. What makes this particular entity increasingly suspicious is the amount of APY they were giving on their platform. Normally, both centralised and decentralised platforms provide an APY of anywhere between 10-15%, which is really great in comparison to what your friendly neighbourhood bank might offer. But what people forget is that many of us are increasingly susceptible to greed; and what looks too good to be true more often than not actually is. The yields registered on Vires Finance were anywhere in between 80- 100% for stablecoins like USDC, USDT and even USDN. That's where it all began.</p>
               <p class="text">One particular whale was continuously manipulating the price of the waves token by continuously buying it using both static as well as borrowed capital. Coming to the borrowed part, what they were trying to do was to borrow USDC and USDT against USDN as collateral which they were minted by continuously buying waves tokens, and then they transferred this USDC and USDT to Binance to buy more waves tokens to artificially pump the price, thereby keeping this inevitable death spiral running unchecked on a loop. This rally dragged in the average retail investor who probably thought things that go up to do so forever. This is a typical example of how whales manipulate markets by playing with the retail sentiment, who often FOMO all into a project thanks to greed and end up getting wrecked so hard that they might even have to lose the family house ( especially if they trade with borrowed capital ) while the smart/evil money ( definition varies with whom you ask ) absconds away gleefully with their hard-earned loot.</p>
               <p class="text">Eventually, people started losing confidence in the project, as in a free market unsustainable pumps without a credible answer can quickly wipe out millions of dollars from the market, and much like every other token trading past all-time highs; the downward slide started. Investors started to panic, as a massive sell pressure of WAVES depegged the supposedly stable coin from its dollar valuation and at one point the USDN was trading at around 68-70 cents; which should never happen to a stable coin. The same people who siphoned off retail money probably even made some more by arbitraging this difference in dollar value on the open markets. You don't really see stable coin blood baths very often, but a protocol guided bloodbath just goes to show that software isn't fully immune to human emotions; particularly greed.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Many people lost a lot of money chasing pumps, and we here at <b>UDAAN</b> advocate fiscal literacy to help you see this asset class not just as a gamble, but more as an educated bet. Risks are associated with everything, but assessing and bypassing risks is something you can only comprehend with the right knowledge. Invest carefully into projects only after carefully analysing the team, modus operandi and to some extent the tokenomics of a project and when you see an absurd pump on a particular token or coin, always <b>DYOR</b> before jumping on the bandwagon that might eventually turn out to be the inevitable doom which satan warned you about while you were resting cosily in La La Land.
