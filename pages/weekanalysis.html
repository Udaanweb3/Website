               <br><br>
               <p class="text">This is financial freedom, you've been dreaming of it for years now. You've been working extremely hard to achieve your goals, only to be disappointed with the results. You're slowly watching all your savings getting eaten up by inflation but your risk tolerance is probably lower than your self-esteem right now, as you're watching your peers potentially on the verge of retiring permanently at 40. All of a sudden a friend shows you this amazing website that helps you earn a 20% yield YoY just by depositing a stable coin into the system as liquidity. He tells you that this is your best shot of not just beating inflation but also earning a sensational yield on your dollars, as banks were paying you virtually nothing as they leveraged your deposits to make their own money, leaving you with nothing. You follow his advice, but little did you know that you're perfectly on track for eventually writing your own Doomsville story in the foreseeable future. This is the story of Terra Luna.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Terra Luna is a project founded by Ivy League-educated computer scientist Do Kwon, who was a personality, to say the least. He was the person behind all the major decisions which Terraform Labs ( the parent company of Terra Luna ) was making in terms of all the developments that were happening in the project; and he was a known dictator in his company as his authoritarian instincts had driven many individuals out from the companies board into abandoning the ship, thereby leaving the project at the mercy of a single entity. He didn't respond to criticism well as he attacked everyone who had something bad to say about his project, and needless to say, his outlook towards life wasn't well appreciated by many of his peers, thereby making him a very unlikeable man in this space, to say the least. The collapse due to a coordinated attack on the Terra Blockchain when Terra was its most vulnerable occurred, and it's highly possible that his previous condescending comments on his competitors might have something to do with the free fall of his project. This incident might have shattered his ego, but it had absolutely decimated all the investors; who were left holding the bags with virtually nothing.
               </p>
               <p class="text">The story begins with the modus operandi of how the peg of the algorithmic stablecoin ( UST )  was maintained. UST, the stable coin that governs the entire ecosystem, was pegged to an underlying asset called LUNA, which was the virtual asset which backed UST instead of cash reserves or cash equivalents in the case of its centralised counterparts like USDC or USDT. They were essentially backed by code, which isn't something that incites confidence amongst the general investor. However, as we know that human beings, in general, are very easily motivated by greed, this was the beginning of a very popular project on Terra, the Anchor Protocol. This popular protocol made the crypto headlines as it promised to give investors a stable 20% yield on UST for just holding UST with them, without any lockup period. This unfathomable return was too good to be true, but nevertheless, people flocked to the protocol to get themselves some free money; I mean who doesn't like free money, right? The problem with this protocol however was the mechanics of its operations, as it behaved like a Ponzi scheme. It lured in a whale investor to invest a truckload of capital into the protocol and convinced the person to not just cash out in the near future, but also promised him/her that the rewards he/she would generate will be given to the person in the form of its anchor token, somewhat similar to shares in the company. This incentivised liquidity into the protocol and initially made it sustainable for the protocol to facilitate such outrageously high-interest rates to his relatively small investors, thereby making it more and more popular. However, what the founders of the project did not weigh in was the popularity that it can amass in a certain period of time. As more and more investors got into the protocol, lured in with not just high-interest rates but also 0 lockup period; Do Kwon realised that this Ponzi-ish architecture wasn't sustainable anymore and it slashed its rewards from 20% to 5%; which discouraged more users to be added into the network. However, this immense and unsustainable growth eventually had its toll on the protocol, as the existing users started to cash out of the system in search of better opportunities elsewhere. This not just dried out liquidity from the protocol but it caused a massive dump of UST onto the open markets, thereby triggering the initial de-pegging of the supposedly stablecoin against the US dollar.
               </p>
               <p class="text">UST and LUNA work in a sort of a feedback mechanism where 1 UST was easily exchangeable for 1 dollar worth of LUNA and vice-versa. Whenever the UST price went above its peg ( say 1.10 ), free-market participants could easily exchange that UST for 1 dollar worth of LUNA, and then sell it for some other stablecoin, thereby making an instantaneous profit of 10 cents on the transaction. This restored the peg. On the contrary, when the peg went below the valuation of a dollar, LUNA was burnt to create 1 UST, the difference of which would be going into the wallets of the person responsible for restoring the peg. This was a very good system in which free-market participants could dictate the direction of not just the stablecoin, but also the project. What made this a more lucrative investment vehicle was that this continuous mint and burn mechanism could eventually make LUNA a deflationary project. We all know in simple supply-demand economics that if supply reduces and demand increases the price is destined to go up. However, this was a clever solution in theory, not in practice.
               </p>
               <p class="text">As inflationary pressures suppressed global markets, investors are trying to move away from risk-on assets like crypto and stocks into more risk-off assets like cash and gold. This form of panic sell-off was first initiated when billions of dollars were sucked out of the anchor protocol and dumped onto the open markets. This crash in UST price was supposed to be counteracted by exchanging UST for LUNA to restore the peg. However, as the markets were already going risk-off, the price of all popular cryptocurrencies including LUNA had fallen drastically and this wasn't sufficient to restore the peg anytime soon. As this lack of confidence kicked in, this free-fall in their market cap eventually led to a key inflexion point where the market cap of LUNA went under that of UST, thereby sending the two tokens into a death spiral. LUNA had eventually wiped out over 45 billion dollars of market cap in a span of 48 hrs and many investors lost everything.
               </p>
               <p class="text">LUNA is a perfect example of the fact that nothing in this world is too big to fail. LUNA was a top 10 project by market cap and evaporated billions of dollars in a matter of days. No matter how talented you might be, ego and enmity will eventually bring about your downfall; maybe not today but someday. Do Kwon is currently in talks with his validators to fork the blockchain to try and give back some of the lost capital to his angry investors, but I highly doubt how successful he'll be with this when he lost all the support and respect from his fellow community members. LUNA didn't die alone but it also brought down the price of Bitcoin along with it as it had kept a fifth of its reserves in BTC, which had to be dumped on the open markets to raise capital to restore the peg of UST. From a potentially deflationary project to hyperinflationary chaos, the project lost its USP which was UST, and chances of revival are not just bleak, they're non-existent. With a heavy heart, I sincerely hope those who were financially involved with the project find solace in some form or the other. Money can always be made back, as long as you live. Please reach out to people if you're feeling alone and suicidal; please look after yourselves. Last but not the least, diversification of your portfolio is a key metric towards financial success, and don't invest more than what you're willing to lose. Don't borrow money or bet on their family house in anticipation of gains, and yes think about your family before betting every single dollar on the hope of fiscal liberty.

               <h1>Week 2 - Safemoon - A not so safe investment.</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="text">Since the inception of cryptocurrencies in general, people have always been on the lookout for the next 10, 100 or even 1000X opportunity that could potentially be the title of their Rags to Riches autobiography someday; but the problem with such speculatory investments is that people often tend to be so greedy that they often bet their house, car, or even life's savings into a project without doing their due diligence just because some influencer on Twitter or Instagram had said that "It's going to be the next big thing". It's a free market, anybody can sell you anything, but it's the responsibility of the purchaser to understand what they're getting into and be responsible with their money. Just because someone is selling you dreams doesn't mean that you have to buy them, and I honestly have zero sympathies for people who get wrecked like this. A Big Shoutout to Coffeezilla for the intense research he did while researching this Ponzi Scheme and we at Udaan will try our best to unearth how Safemoon has been slowly but steadily syphoning liquidity out of their protocol for months now.
               </p>
               <p class="text">If the name itself wasn't a giveaway, there was nothing safe about this project, and what made it even more dangerous was that it wasn't a classical case of an instantaneous rug pull, it was more like slow poisoning someone. The CEO of the project John Karony had copied the source code of the project from a previous project known as bee token, which was infamous for being the case of a classical rug pull. The CEO then tried to explain some sort of convoluted jargon about how the liquidity is locked into the protocol and guess what, it all turned out to be entirely false. There was no locked liquidity as the Safemoon core team had been slowly but steadily syphoning away liquidity from the protocol to not grab attention and spook out investors and when confronted about their self-contradictory statements on locked liquidity, their response was plain and simple, you got to trust us. Essentially yet another "Pinky Promise Protocol" as coined by Coffeezilla in his recent take on the situation.
               </p>
               <p class="text">The modus operandi of the protocol was to charge taxes of 10% initially to every user who wanted to transact in Safemoon tokens, out of which 5% would be returned into the liquidity and the other 5% would be redistributed to all the holders of this token. This potentially made it more lucrative for investors to continue holding the token for potentially higher gains in the future, which sadly wasn't the case as the token plummeted over 90% from its all-time high, never to recover again. The team is very public on Twitter, Reddit and even LinkedIn, where they try to bring more liquidity by hyping up gullible community members to pour more money into the protocol to make the syphoning process less obvious, as they tried to remain off the grid by attempting to balance capital inflow and capital outflow out of the liquidity pool to help keep the price steady and not give it characteristics of a rug pull. They used a bunch of stupid concepts to justify the roadmap and goals of the project, by introducing terms like version 2 upgrade and project Pheonix to keep investors in the loop and keep them talking about the project online. One fun fact is that the CEO had misspelt Phoenix for Phoenix and was so stubborn that he launched the project particulars with the incorrect spelling in order to satisfy his ego. He was not only a  shitty visionary but also someone who probably didn't take grammar seriously in school. The team even hired stupid influencers on the internet who were paid off to hype up the project even further, thereby giving their company a valuation of over 3 billion dollars in a span of 9 months.</p>
               <p class="text">Rugpulls aren't exactly unheard of in the cryptoverse , especially with low market cap projects. This is one of the few reasons why you should be sensible with your hard-earned funds. You should always invest that much that you can afford to lose, betting the family house or family farm isn't exactly what smart people do. Always research the credibility of the core dev team, the tokenomics of the project and its goals before even thinking about putting your money into a project and one last thing, don't invest in a project just because some moon boy on Instagram said that you can double your money in a matter of days. Safemoon currently has several class-action lawsuits filed against them and is currently under investigation by the FBI for fraudulent activities. Needless to say, the Dev team and the influencers were happy as they have amassed a lot of money which could even potentially help them not just fight the case but also have plenty left over to lead a comfortable retired life, thereby making sure the people who actually trusted the project and its people can never retire.</p>

               <h1>Week 1 - USDN - The not so stable coin.</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">That's where stable coins come into play.</p>
               <p class="text">The neutrino stable coin, also abbreviated as <b>USDN</b>, is an integral part of the Waves Ecosystem, and this has been headlines in the cryptocurrency space recently for all the wrong reasons. To all those who aren't aware of the project, Waves, also nicknamed the Russian Ethereum, is another Layer 1 blockchain available in the space competing against the likes of more established players like Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. On their website, I personally didn't find anything which is different from what all the other established players are doing, and the website was eerily resembling yet another Layer 1 protocol comprising of generic fluff. However, the charts were speaking an entirely different story as the token pumped more than 300% in a matter of weeks without much technical substance that was released on their official social media accounts. Also, alt season has far from begun as this was an isolated surge and none of the technical indicators is showing bullish momentum any time soon. Was it an organic growth or yet another pump and dump scheme? Let's discuss this situation in depth.</p>
               <p class="text">Needless to say, some whale had been manipulating the price of the Waves token over the past few days, and this again is one of the key differences between the security of a proof of work blockchain and the susceptibility to corruption of a proof of stake network. The centre of attraction of all that went south was the USDN stable coin, and an entity known as Vires Finance.
               </p>
               <p class="text">A little background about Vires Finance, it is just another liquidity aggregator where users can deposit stable coins to earn interest yields on their deposits. What makes this particular entity increasingly suspicious is the amount of APY they were giving on their platform. Normally, both centralised and decentralised platforms provide an APY of anywhere between 10-15%, which is really great in comparison to what your friendly neighbourhood bank might offer. But what people forget is that many of us are increasingly susceptible to greed; and what looks too good to be true more often than not actually is. The yields registered on Vires Finance were anywhere in between 80- 100% for stablecoins like USDC, USDT and even USDN. That's where it all began.</p>
               <p class="text">One particular whale was continuously manipulating the price of the waves token by continuously buying it using both static as well as borrowed capital. Coming to the borrowed part, what they were trying to do was to borrow USDC and USDT against USDN as collateral which they were minted by continuously buying waves tokens, and then they transferred this USDC and USDT to Binance to buy more waves tokens to artificially pump the price, thereby keeping this inevitable death spiral running unchecked on a loop. This rally dragged in the average retail investor who probably thought things that go up to do so forever. This is a typical example of how whales manipulate markets by playing with the retail sentiment, who often FOMO all into a project thanks to greed and end up getting wrecked so hard that they might even have to lose the family house ( especially if they trade with borrowed capital ) while the smart/evil money ( definition varies with whom you ask ) absconds away gleefully with their hard-earned loot.</p>
               <p class="text">Eventually, people started losing confidence in the project, as in a free market unsustainable pumps without a credible answer can quickly wipe out millions of dollars from the market, and much like every other token trading past all-time highs; the downward slide started. Investors started to panic, as a massive sell pressure of WAVES depegged the supposedly stable coin from its dollar valuation and at one point the USDN was trading at around 68-70 cents; which should never happen to a stable coin. The same people who siphoned off retail money probably even made some more by arbitraging this difference in dollar value on the open markets. You don't really see stable coin blood baths very often, but a protocol guided bloodbath just goes to show that software isn't fully immune to human emotions; particularly greed.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Many people lost a lot of money chasing pumps, and we here at <b>UDAAN</b> advocate fiscal literacy to help you see this asset class not just as a gamble, but more as an educated bet. Risks are associated with everything, but assessing and bypassing risks is something you can only comprehend with the right knowledge. Invest carefully into projects only after carefully analysing the team, modus operandi and to some extent the tokenomics of a project and when you see an absurd pump on a particular token or coin, always <b>DYOR</b> before jumping on the bandwagon that might eventually turn out to be the inevitable doom which satan warned you about while you were resting cosily in La La Land.
