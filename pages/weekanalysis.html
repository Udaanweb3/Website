               <h1>Week 2 - Safemoon - A not so safe investment.</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="text">Since the inception of cryptocurrencies in general, people have always been on the lookout for the next 10, 100 or even 1000X opportunity that could potentially be the title of their Rags to Riches autobiography someday; but the problem with such speculatory investments is that people often tend to be so greedy that they often bet their house, car, or even life's savings into a project without doing their due diligence just because some influencer on Twitter or Instagram had said that "It's going to be the next big thing". It's a free market, anybody can sell you anything, but it's the responsibility of the purchaser to understand what they're getting into and be responsible with their money. Just because someone is selling you dreams doesn't mean that you have to buy them, and I honestly have zero sympathies for people who get wrecked like this. A Big Shoutout to Coffeezilla for the intense research he did while researching this Ponzi Scheme and we at Udaan will try our best to unearth how Safemoon has been slowly but steadily syphoning liquidity out of their protocol for months now.
               </p>
               <p class="text">If the name itself wasn't a giveaway, there was nothing safe about this project, and what made it even more dangerous was that it wasn't a classical case of an instantaneous rug pull, it was more like slow poisoning someone. The CEO of the project John Karony had copied the source code of the project from a previous project known as bee token, which was infamous for being the case of a classical rug pull. The CEO then tried to explain some sort of convoluted jargon about how the liquidity is locked into the protocol and guess what, it all turned out to be entirely false. There was no locked liquidity as the Safemoon core team had been slowly but steadily syphoning away liquidity from the protocol to not grab attention and spook out investors and when confronted about their self-contradictory statements on locked liquidity, their response was plain and simple, you got to trust us. Essentially yet another "Pinky Promise Protocol" as coined by Coffeezilla in his recent take on the situation.
               </p>
               <p class="text">The modus operandi of the protocol was to charge taxes of 10% initially to every user who wanted to transact in Safemoon tokens, out of which 5% would be returned into the liquidity and the other 5% would be redistributed to all the holders of this token. This potentially made it more lucrative for investors to continue holding the token for potentially higher gains in the future, which sadly wasn't the case as the token plummeted over 90% from its all-time high, never to recover again. The team is very public on Twitter, Reddit and even LinkedIn, where they try to bring more liquidity by hyping up gullible community members to pour more money into the protocol to make the syphoning process less obvious, as they tried to remain off the grid by attempting to balance capital inflow and capital outflow out of the liquidity pool to help keep the price steady and not give it characteristics of a rug pull. They used a bunch of stupid concepts to justify the roadmap and goals of the project, by introducing terms like version 2 upgrade and project Pheonix to keep investors in the loop and keep them talking about the project online. One fun fact is that the CEO had misspelt Phoenix for Phoenix and was so stubborn that he launched the project particulars with the incorrect spelling in order to satisfy his ego. He was not only a  shitty visionary but also someone who probably didn't take grammar seriously in school. The team even hired stupid influencers on the internet who were paid off to hype up the project even further, thereby giving their company a valuation of over 3 billion dollars in a span of 9 months.</p>
               <p class="text">Rugpulls aren't exactly unheard of in the cryptoverse , especially with low market cap projects. This is one of the few reasons why you should be sensible with your hard-earned funds. You should always invest that much that you can afford to lose, betting the family house or family farm isn't exactly what smart people do. Always research the credibility of the core dev team, the tokenomics of the project and its goals before even thinking about putting your money into a project and one last thing, don't invest in a project just because some moon boy on Instagram said that you can double your money in a matter of days. Safemoon currently has several class-action lawsuits filed against them and is currently under investigation by the FBI for fraudulent activities. Needless to say, the Dev team and the influencers were happy as they have amassed a lot of money which could even potentially help them not just fight the case but also have plenty left over to lead a comfortable retired life, thereby making sure the people who actually trusted the project and its people can never retire.</p>

               <h1>Week 1 - USDN - The not so stable coin.</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">That's where stable coins come into play.</p>
               <p class="text">The neutrino stable coin, also abbreviated as <b>USDN</b>, is an integral part of the Waves Ecosystem, and this has been headlines in the cryptocurrency space recently for all the wrong reasons. To all those who aren't aware of the project, Waves, also nicknamed the Russian Ethereum, is another Layer 1 blockchain available in the space competing against the likes of more established players like Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. On their website, I personally didn't find anything which is different from what all the other established players are doing, and the website was eerily resembling yet another Layer 1 protocol comprising of generic fluff. However, the charts were speaking an entirely different story as the token pumped more than 300% in a matter of weeks without much technical substance that was released on their official social media accounts. Also, alt season has far from begun as this was an isolated surge and none of the technical indicators is showing bullish momentum any time soon. Was it an organic growth or yet another pump and dump scheme? Let's discuss this situation in depth.</p>
               <p class="text">Needless to say, some whale had been manipulating the price of the Waves token over the past few days, and this again is one of the key differences between the security of a proof of work blockchain and the susceptibility to corruption of a proof of stake network. The centre of attraction of all that went south was the USDN stable coin, and an entity known as Vires Finance.
               </p>
               <p class="text">A little background about Vires Finance, it is just another liquidity aggregator where users can deposit stable coins to earn interest yields on their deposits. What makes this particular entity increasingly suspicious is the amount of APY they were giving on their platform. Normally, both centralised and decentralised platforms provide an APY of anywhere between 10-15%, which is really great in comparison to what your friendly neighbourhood bank might offer. But what people forget is that many of us are increasingly susceptible to greed; and what looks too good to be true more often than not actually is. The yields registered on Vires Finance were anywhere in between 80- 100% for stablecoins like USDC, USDT and even USDN. That's where it all began.</p>
               <p class="text">One particular whale was continuously manipulating the price of the waves token by continuously buying it using both static as well as borrowed capital. Coming to the borrowed part, what they were trying to do was to borrow USDC and USDT against USDN as collateral which they were minted by continuously buying waves tokens, and then they transferred this USDC and USDT to Binance to buy more waves tokens to artificially pump the price, thereby keeping this inevitable death spiral running unchecked on a loop. This rally dragged in the average retail investor who probably thought things that go up to do so forever. This is a typical example of how whales manipulate markets by playing with the retail sentiment, who often FOMO all into a project thanks to greed and end up getting wrecked so hard that they might even have to lose the family house ( especially if they trade with borrowed capital ) while the smart/evil money ( definition varies with whom you ask ) absconds away gleefully with their hard-earned loot.</p>
               <p class="text">Eventually, people started losing confidence in the project, as in a free market unsustainable pumps without a credible answer can quickly wipe out millions of dollars from the market, and much like every other token trading past all-time highs; the downward slide started. Investors started to panic, as a massive sell pressure of WAVES depegged the supposedly stable coin from its dollar valuation and at one point the USDN was trading at around 68-70 cents; which should never happen to a stable coin. The same people who siphoned off retail money probably even made some more by arbitraging this difference in dollar value on the open markets. You don't really see stable coin blood baths very often, but a protocol guided bloodbath just goes to show that software isn't fully immune to human emotions; particularly greed.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Many people lost a lot of money chasing pumps, and we here at <b>UDAAN</b> advocate fiscal literacy to help you see this asset class not just as a gamble, but more as an educated bet. Risks are associated with everything, but assessing and bypassing risks is something you can only comprehend with the right knowledge. Invest carefully into projects only after carefully analysing the team, modus operandi and to some extent the tokenomics of a project and when you see an absurd pump on a particular token or coin, always <b>DYOR</b> before jumping on the bandwagon that might eventually turn out to be the inevitable doom which satan warned you about while you were resting cosily in La La Land.
