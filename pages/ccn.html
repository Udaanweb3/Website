               <h1>Cryptocurrency for Newbies!</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="text"> The idea of cryptocurrencies comes from the basis of <b>Blockchain</b> which uses cryptography to secure transactions. Simply put, cryptocurrencies are <b>electronic peer-to-peer</b> currencies. They don't exist in physical form. You cannot pull one out of your wallet and hold it in your hand. But just because you can't physically hold a bitcoin, it doesn't mean they aren't worth anything, as you've probably noticed by the significant rise in popularity of cryptocurrency. Technically, the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer currency was being tinkered with decades ago, but it wasn't truly successful until 2008 when bitcoin was conceived by <b>“Satoshi Nakamoto”</b>. The basis of bitcoin's creation, and all virtual currencies that have since followed, was to fix a number of perceived flaws with the way fiat money is transmitted from one party to another.</p>
               <p class="text">Cryptocurrencies are built upon certain Blockchains such as <b>Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain</b> or their own Blockchain where all the records of transactions and each and every detail of holders can be viewed by anyone from anywhere.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Cryptocurrencies remove the gap between transferring fiat from one country to another via Swift or other means. For Example, Person A sitting in India can transfer Ripple to Person B located in the USA at a basic <b>0.25 XRP ($ 0.20)</b> transaction charge.</p>
               <p class="text"> Cryptocurrencies play a major role in <b>Metaverse</b>, which is another topic.
                  <b>El Salvador</b> is the first country to make <b>Bitcoin Legal Tender</b> which will boost their <b>GDP</b> and <b>Economic Growth</b> very soon, other countries like Russia and the USA are also on the same road.
               </p>
               <p class="text"> The <b>7 types of cryptocurrencies</b> that exist for now are: Security Tokens, Equity Tokens, Asset-backed Tokens, Utility Tokens, Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs), Stablecoins, Meme coins
               </p>
               <p class="text">Some examples of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Burnly and Shiba Inu.
               </p>
               <p class="subhead">Economics</p>
               <p class="text">Famous big hitters of the investing world like <b>Warren Buffett</b> have never refrained from calling even the skyrocketing Bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” & “Stay away from it. It’s a mirage, basically.” Even JP Morgan Chase employees were warned of being fired if they were found trading while the company was going to release a report on the cryptocurrency.</p>
               <p class="text">According to a study conducted by <b>Cambridge University</b> in 2017, there were between 2.9 million and 5.8 million unique users who were actively using their cryptocurrency wallets, most of them using Bitcoin as well. This can be seen as a clear indication of the hype around the popular coin where people have been trading it in spite of warnings from many famous investors. The economic theory suggests that the volatility of the price of Bitcoin shall drop upon its increase in business and consumer usage.</p>
               <p class="subhead">Social Tends</p>
               <p class="text">Electric car innovator and SpaceX CEO, <b>Elon Musk</b> has been talking through Twitter about how he let Tesla Merchandise be paid for with the cryptocurrency Dogecoin. His tweet sent the coin surging to +14%. His initial tweet <b>“Dogecoin rulz”</b> sent the coin <b>surging by 40%</b>.
               </p>
               <p class="text">A few people have even criticised him on the ‘controversial’ tweets he’s made on different currencies which have led to many lives being destroyed, but, more people were treating him like a hero, taking to Twitter with “#WeLoveYouElon”, even in India.
               </p>
               <p class="subhead">Legality - India</p>
               <p class="text">Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s recent proposal to tax virtual assets, including cryptocurrencies has spread many images in different people’s minds; Some believe it’s the first step to recognising cryptocurrencies as a legal virtual currency while some believe coins like Bitcoin are not yet a legal tender in India.
                  Sitharaman also didn’t fail to mention the Digital Rupee which would be backed by RBI, basically meaning the money would be of RBI but the format would be switched to digital. T.V. Somanthan, the Finance Secretary of India also mentioned that the tenders of cryptocurrencies that were not made legal, are also not to be taken as ‘illegal’, which also led to vast confusion in the tender.
               </p>
               <p class="subhead">Impact & Analysis</p>
               <p class="text">In 2020, the crypto market was valued at $0.25 trillion and was projected to reach<b> 20 trillion by the year 2030</b>. The crypto market bloomed thereafter and is currently valued at <b>$2.1 trillion</b>. Some reports have also suggested a market growth two times faster in India and to increase the job opportunities by 2030.
               </p>
               <p class="text">The invention of cryptocurrencies has led to a new era in the modern exchange technique. The possibilities it brings are <b>endless</b> and will be the backbone of the <b>virtual world</b> and its future developments.
