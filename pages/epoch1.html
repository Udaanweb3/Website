               <h1>The Fiscal Saviour</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="subhead">Traditional finance has become a joke nowadays!</p>
               <p class="text">Governments print money, devaluing their own sovereign currency just to keep on exercising political autonomy for another term, and yet another. Amidst a global pandemic, with thousands of people losing their jobs, their homes and eventually whatever little self-esteem they possessed pre-pandemic, these stimulus checks by the US government were a ray of hope for these genuinely distressed beings. Families could finally afford three meals a day, at least one meal comprising of hot food, enabled their children to resume their online education and even buy those lifesaving meds that were discontinued for a long time thanks to bankruptcy.</p>
               <p class="text">You might argue all this was necessary, especially from a humanitarian perspective; and rightfully so it surely was. What the people in power had forgotten was that every good thing needs to come to an end, otherwise lemons can turn sour really quickly. Every operation, good or bad, needs to have a stop button. The continued payment of financial aid even after much of the economy had already reopened led to what is broadly known as <b>"The Great Resignation"</b>. Nobody wanted to return back to work, as they are already getting paid every month for doing absolutely nothing.This prolonged money printing might have helped them secure a good deal of votes for the next election. </p>
               <p class="subhead"> But at what cost?</p>
               <p class="text">Paper money is essentially an <b>"I Owe you"</b> issued by a trusted third party (in this case the Federal Reserve) and its value holds good as long as the bank thinks it does. But you'll be surprised to know that the almighty <b>US dollar</b> was actually backed by solid gold until 1971 when the then US president <b>Richard Nixon</b> decided to put it off the gold standard in order to address rising inflation in the country. Needless to say, everything has been going south ever since. The pieces of government-backed paper that you hold in your wallets are virtually backed by thin air and can and will certainly cease to exist if your government falls apart. This is exactly what is happening in Venezuela, Argentina and Zimbabwe where their official currency is just withering away in a ditch. People in power manipulate the sovereignty of their National currency for personally vested interests and as a consequence of their actions, it is the working class people that suffer. The concept of value is in shambles thanks to governments around the world that are slowly transforming us into slaves of a system from where there is no escape. It's like being in quicksand and helplessly trying to stay afloat while the soil beneath you keeps on sucking you into its vortex of impending doom.</p>
               <p class="text"><b>Blockchain technology</b>, the main foundation of all these cryptocurrencies is the knight in shining armour that can eventually save us all from becoming thrall to a villain, a.k.a autocratic regimes wearing democratic masks. In the subsequent articles, we shall read more about how this revolutionary technology can lead to what I like to call <b>"The Great Re-Distribution" of value</b>.</p>
