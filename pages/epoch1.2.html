               <h1>Stable Coins</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="text"> If you're new to the crypto-verse, you might have heard the term <b>“Stablecoins”</b>. But you might wonder why price fluctuations for stable coins are negligible as compared to many high market cap projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The answer to it is simple, they're <b>stable</b>, duh! The existence of stable coins is quintessential in cryptocurrency markets because, at the end of a juicy profit cashout, you would need some investment vehicle to actually retain your gains, right? </p>
               <p class="subhead">That's where stable coins come into play</p>
               <p class="text">Stable coins are broadly classified into two types, <b>decentralised</b> and <b>centralised</b> stable coins. The purpose of these cryptocurrencies is the same, to retain a peg to an underlying asset that remains constant even during times of severe market volatility. The assets under consideration are usually either gold or the US dollar. Their mechanism of action, however, is what creates the difference.
               </p>
               <p class="text">Decentralised stable coins like the <b>DAI</b> (is a stable coin cryptocurrency that aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain) and <b>UST</b> are algorithmic by nature; they usually maintain their peg by a simple demand and supply mechanism, where the algorithm sells tokens when the value of the coin goes above the peg and vice versa. Let's take the example of UST, which is a decentralised stable coin issued on the <b>Terra Blockchain</b>. The value of UST is directly correlated to the Token Luna on the Terra Blockchain. In order to maintain the peg,<b> LUNA</b> is burnt whenever the value of UST goes above the peg and this burn mechanism keeps on continuing as more and more UST is minted and used inside the crypto ecosystem. Thereby making LUNA a potentially deflationary asset.</p>
               <p class="text"> Centralised stable coins, on the contrary, are stable coins that are issued by a centralised organisation by pegging their value to real-world hard assets like US dollars, commercial bonds, and precious metals. They claim to have a one to one backing and are considered to be more trustworthy by the average retail investor; as they can trust the liquidity of the system. Tether is perhaps the largest centralised stable coin by market cap, followed closely by Circles USDC. However, there has been a change in sentiment amongst investors concerning Tether as a recent audit has shed light on how much commercial paper they are holding as opposed to the US dollar; and in case of a black swan event, there are high chances there might be a liquidity crunch and the company might not be able to cater to all its customers all at once. This is deeply concerning as such bank runs are most definitely not unheard of, especially with the fractional banking system that is a consistent practice of maximum banks all across the globe. In order to generate more revenue, these banking institutions lend out more than what they should keep locked in their reserves and when a global cascade of fiscal collapse ensues, the banks are the first ones to declare bankruptcy and desperately wait for the central reserves to bail them out. Examples of such events include the Financial crash of 2008, the 2012-13 Cypriot Financial crisis, and the more recent Lebanese financial crisis. Tether has been guilty of this fractional banking mechanism and this lack of backing has led to the increase in market cap of USDC over USDT, which has way more dollars and hard assets inside their vault and is perhaps much better suited to tackle such a potential black swan event.</p>
               <p class="subhead">To conclude</p>
               <p class="text"> Both these types of stable coins have their pros and cons. When the average Joe is investing in crypto, he does not understand protocol governance; he only understands whether the digital dollar he has in his wallet is redeemable to actually fiat currency. Centralised stable coins are more prone to fiscal situations as at the end of the day, humans are the ones in charge of running these centralised entities, and most of us are prone to greed. Leverage is what pops a bubble, and leverage is a fiscal instrument that is a staple of the financial forerunners over on wall street. Personally, as someone who understands technology, decentralised stable coins are governed by protocols; which are in turn immune to human emotions like greed. This creates a sense of consistency, while centralised cryptocurrencies can create a false narrative of security as greedy corporations can silently eat away at your gains as you sleep. Education is a key element to help people make an informed decision with respect to their personal finance and our goal is to provide clarity to our viewers so they don't get wrecked in this increasingly new but exciting era that we're living in. Also, do remember that this isn't financial advice!
