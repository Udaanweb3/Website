               <h1>The Metaverse - The newest macro-goal!</h1>
               <br><br>
               <p class="text">Imagine a world where you start your day with your regular morning rituals, leave for work, attend business meetings, and then finally meet up with friends to end the day with the performance of your favourite artist while being at their concert, all from the comfort of your home, all cosied up in your bed. That might just be humanity's future, a world where time and space mean nothing, a world where we all partially exist and function in a virtual world; where we can all live, work and play, in the Metaverse!</p>
               <p class="text">The Metaverse is really hard to explain, as it doesn't exactly have a static definition per se. It can be referred to as a means of technological interoperability where individuals can interact with the internet in a more holistic manner, rather than just being stuck to a two-dimensional version of the internet from the 90s. Because of the Metaverse, an individual can potentially bypass needless experiences in the outside world like being stuck in traffic for hours or even avert potential health adversities by remotely operating from a distance, especially in the wake of a global pandemic. From a macroeconomic perspective, the Metaverse can potentially increase work efficiency, especially when companies are adopting a hybrid work model to safeguard employees of the organization from contracting the virus. A paradigm shift can potentially disrupt the way value is created in the future, especially if mega corporations start holding business practices in the Metaverse, thereby saving millions in office architecture, electricity, food and other amenities, thereby increasing profit margins and also increasing work efficiency in the corporate world.
               </p>
               <p class="text">In the previous generation of the internet, the interaction between people was very static per se, one used to press buttons on their phones or PCs in order to type text messages, play games etc. Users had to create accounts on several different platforms to access their services, and it was very difficult to link your activities from one platform to another. The concept of the Metaverse is really liberating as the only thing users have to create is a digital Avatar, and that's it and you're good to go. You don't have to physically be near your phone or PC to interact with the Metaverse, you can experience everything within it by simply putting on your VR goggles and simulating all your real-world actions in a virtual reality ecosystem.</p>
               <p class="text">The Metaverse is an entirely different ecosystem where real-world physical assets have little to no importance. You'll be transacting in cryptocurrencies, using NFTs. All this might sound like technology which might be at least 10-20 years from now, but you'll be hugely mistaken if you sleep on this disruptive force that can redefine the way we live. All the tools needed to build the Metaverse are already present, what we're lacking is access to high speed High bandwidth internet connectivity to a third of the world's population. With an increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, innovation will continue to happen, what will not happen is the execution and mass outreach of this technology that is capable today but not capable of being perceived until tomorrow. Bridges can and will be made bigger and better if only the gaps between them are reduced effectively.</p>
               <p class="text">To conclude, the Metaverse isn't exactly a bed of roses. There are many things that can label it more as a dystopian nightmare, rather than a utopian dream. For instance, your digital presence is more amplified in the Metaverse, as unlike the 2D version of the internet we're used to, in the Metaverse your digital Avatar will have information about not just your browsing history but it will also have a lot of personal information such as your behaviour, mannerisms, moods and a whole array of expressions. If you were worried about companies profiting from your browsing data, wait until they start selling your emotions on the marketplace, a feeling that should strictly be limited to the individual. Since companies are already in the race to establish the gold standard against which all other metaverses will be built in the future, it is very important that decentralised blockchain projects like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Illuvium win the race in comparison to centralised counterparts like Meta, Apple or even Google for that matter. Another major risk with the Metaverse is addiction. Just like what happens to many gamers who more often than not do it full time as a way of putting food on the table. Let's take the example of an average Instagram model, who probably takes a hundred pictures to post that one good picture on the internet, coupled with a dozen filters which makes them fall in love with this altered and morphed version of their own self.
               </p>
               <p class="text">In the Metaverse, all these can be heightened exponentially, where people might get so addicted to how they look in the Metaverse that they stop caring about their own selves, in the real world. People might be eating their fruits and vegetables in the Metaverse but might be malnourished in real life, they might regularly exercise in the Metaverse but might be obese in actuality. People might fall deeply in love with their online presence and thus start completely neglecting what their real-life needs are, or in some dystopian universe; start hating what they truly are.
                  Just like every other technological innovation we've had till the dawn of time, it all comes down to how we as individuals use these services for uplifting our social quotient in general and existential quotient in particular. Everything in life comprises good, bad and ugly; Technology has given us both Digital Computing for facilitating business and also given us the 911 attack. Evolution is like a constant change that will keep on happening, and the Metaverse is the new era of life. New laws will need to be formulated to safeguard your digital presence, new equipment would be needed to enhance your VR experiences; but with life transitioning into a new era, it is our responsibility as individuals to be digitally responsible for our actions and function in accordance with our old tried and tested ideals; to change the way we live, not life altogether.
